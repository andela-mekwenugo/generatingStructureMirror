There are 2 data sets in this repository. One contains keywords performance data, another one contains ad group data.
You can join the data together on the AdGroupId. Once that is done you can start with the assignments.

Please make sure you show clearly how you completed each assignment and feel free to comment anywhere to elaborate on
what you we're doing.
